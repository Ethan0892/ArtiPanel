- npm install may require resolution of jsonwebtoken version conflicts
- Performance optimization pending (focus was on feature completeness)
- Some advanced features may lack documentation
- Community testing ongoing

### Limitations

- **Not production-ready** - Early alpha, stability not guaranteed
